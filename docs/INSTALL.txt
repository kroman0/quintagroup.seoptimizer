quintagroup.seoptimizer Installation
==========================

To install quintagroup.seoptimizer into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

 * When you're reading this you have probably already run
   ``easy_install quintagroup.seoptimizer``. Find out how to install setuptools
   (and EasyInstall) here:
   http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

 * Create a file called ``quintagroup.seoptimizer-configure.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
   should only contain this::

       <include package="quintagroup.seoptimizer" file="configure.zcml" />

    and create a file called ``quintagroup.seoptimizer-overrides.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
   should only contain this::

       <include package="quintagroup.seoptimizer" file="overrides.zcml" />

Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

 * Add ``quintagroup.seoptimizer`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    parts =
        ...
        src-eggs
    ....
    eggs =
        ...
        quintagroup.seoptimizer

    [src-eggs]
    recipe=infrae.subversion
    urls =
        http://svn.quintagroup.com/products/quintagroup.seoptimizer/trunk quintagroup.seoptimizer

    as_eggs = true
    location = src

  * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        quintagroup.seoptimizer
        quintagroup.seoptimizer-overrides

  * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout

You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
