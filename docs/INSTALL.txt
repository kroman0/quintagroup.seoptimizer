============

Traditional Zope 2 Instance
---------------------------

To install quintagroup.seoptimizer into the global Python environment (or a workingenv), using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

* Copy ``quintagroup`` folder to your instance's */lib/python* directory.

* Create a file called ``quintagroup.seoptimizer-configure.zcml`` in your instance's */etc/package-includes* directory. The file should only contain this::

  <include package="quintagroup.seoptimizer" file="configure.zcml" />

* Create a file called ``quintagroup.seoptimizer-overrides.zcml`` in your instance's */etc/package-includes* directory. The file should only contain this::

  <include package="quintagroup.seoptimizer" file="overrides.zcml" />

* Restart the Zope server, for example with the following command in the terminal::

   $ ./bin/zopectl restart


Buildout
--------

Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``quintagroup.seoptimizer`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

   [buildout]
   ....
   eggs =
        ...
        quintagroup.seoptimizer

* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

   [instance]
   ...
   zcml =
       quintagroup.seoptimizer
       quintagroup.seoptimizer-overrides

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

   $ ./bin/buildout

* Restart the Zope server, e.g with the following command in the terminal::

   $ ./bin/instance restart
