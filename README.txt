Requirements
------------

* Plone 3.x, Plone 4.0

quintagroup.seoptimizer requires plone.browserlayer package to be installed in your site. plone.browserlayer package is shipped with Plone >= 3.1 and thus you don't need anything extra when you have that version of Plone.

But for Plone 3.0.x < 3.1 the process looks like this:

    * if you are creating a new Plone site and want it to support Quintagroup Search Engine Optimization Tool, just select 2 extension profiles Local browser layer support and quintagroup.seoptimizer profile in 'Extension Profiles' when adding a new Plone site;
    * if you want to add quintagroup.seoptimizer to already-existing Plone site, you need to apply Local browser layer support extension profile and then quintagroup.seoptimizer profile. You can do it either in  portal_setup/Import or in portal_quickinstaller by simple installation procedure.

In Plone 3.1 you can simply install quintagroup.seoptimizer profile in portal_quickinstaller without need of prior installation of Local browser layer support (that is not available for installation anyway, since it is a part of core system).

IMPORTANT! For Plone 3.0.x you should use plone.browserlayer 1.0.rc3. Be sure to define the right version of plone.browserlayer in your buildout.cfg. For Plone 3.1.x just use the version you have.


Notes
-----

* For Plone 4 versions - use Plone SEO 4.0 release and up http://plone.org/products/plone-seo/releases/4.0. In your buildout.cfg file's egg section set product version::

   [buildout]
   ....
   eggs =
        ...
        quintagroup.seoptimizer >=4.0

* For Plone 3 versions - use the latest Plone SEO 3.x release http://plone.org/products/plone-seo/releases/3.0.5. In your buildout.cfg file's egg section set product version::

   [buildout]
   ....
   eggs =
        ...
        quintagroup.seoptimizer >3.0,<4.0
